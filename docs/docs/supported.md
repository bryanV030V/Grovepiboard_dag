# Supported Modules

A [grid list of supported modules](https://www.dexterindustries.com/grovepi/) (sensors and actuators) can be seen on our page somewhere in the middle of it - you need to scroll down quite a lot.
Upon scrolling down, you'll see a list that looks like this one down below.

# DI-Sensors

The GrovePi can also be used along with our [DI-Sensors](https://github.com/DexterInd/DI_Sensors/) that require an I2C interface. The GrovePi has 3 I2C ports which can be used for interfacing with these sensors. More can be found in the [DI-Sensors Documentation](http://di-sensors.readthedocs.io).
